                    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Albin Berglund</strong>. 
                    I am studying <strong>Information Technology</strong> engineering at Arcada, and I am filming part-time with a drone.
                    I have been interested in software development since 2016. It's been a whirlwind of learning and coding ever since. 
                    Always been a tech enthusiast, and the more I explore, the more I realize how much there is to discover, even though it can be scary at times.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2024 I finished the <strong>mandatory military service</strong>, I served my mandatory military service in Dragsvik and I had the responsibility of a group as an <strong>Alikersantti</strong>.
                        I have developed skills in leadership, teamwork, and physical and mental endurance.
                        In addition, I have strengthened my skills in entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship, focusing on strategic planning, marketing, finance, and leadership. 
                        I have experience working with both small and large organizations and am used to taking initiative and driving projects forward.</p>
